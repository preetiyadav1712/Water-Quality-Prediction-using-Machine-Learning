# Water-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict the water quality of a lake or river. The project uses a variety of water quality parameters, such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen, to train a machine learning model. The model can then be used to predict the water quality of the lake or river at any given time.
